## Programming Languages
We know how  all programming languages work: You write code to the computer to tell it what to do, but there are actually 2 different types of programming languages: compiled and interpreted. <br>
#### Compiled
A **Compiler** can be defined as a machine or a program that converts instructions from one language to another, for programming languages a compiler converts the code to a machine-languaje or low level language so that it can be read and executed by a computer. <br>
Compiled Languages are directly translated to a machine code that it's executed by the processor. This types of languages give more control over the memory management, every time you need to change the code the program needs to be "rebuiled" (that means it needs to be compiled again). Some examples of this types of languages are: C,C++,Rust.
#### Interpreted
An **Interpreter** it's a program that reads the code line by line and traduce it to the computer for it to execute each instruccion line by line. Interpreted Languages do exactly the same, they are executed line by line. Some examples of this languages are: Python, JavaScript, Ruby.
